**Scut is a collection of Sass utilities to ease and improve our implementations of common style-code patterns.**

You can think of the word Scut as an acronym for ***S***ass-***C***SS ***Ut***itilies.

(Or you can think of the word in other ways: Scut will do your *scut work*; let Scut be your *scut monkey*. (But whatever you may do at home, be careful how you use this word in polite company. To learn its many and colorful connotations, [have a look at Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scut).))

**BE AWARE:** Scut is in early stages, under active development, *unstable* &mdash; still in [SemVer](http://semver.org/) v0. **Scut is wide, wide open to contributions**, and I will be building on it myself. New features will be added and old features might be improved. So: **if some part of Scut that you had been using suddenly doesn't work, please check this documentation to see what changed.**
