Having imported `_scut.scss`, use the mixins and placeholders described below in the manner described below.

If you have any questions about how to use Sass/SCSS, refer to [the thorough Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html).

If the Scut documentation below is inadequate or upsetting, please [file an issue](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scut/issues) or [contact me](https://github.com/davidtheclark).

### Browser Support

Most of Scut's utilities should work magnificently in any modern browser and IE8+.

If a specific utility *does* have compatibility issues (and some do), those issues should be noted in the documentation below. (If they are not, please let me know.)
