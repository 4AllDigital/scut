Yes, you can and should contribute.

Scut is all about making your work, my work, and the work of other developers easier, maybe even a little bit better; extending tutorials into reusable utilities; encouraging best practices; and sharing good ideas &mdash; goals we can agree on. I hope you'll find it a worthy experiment.

[Visit the repository on Github](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scut) and file issues and pull requests according to the usual Github methods. A little contribution guide is included in the README there.

If you have any questions, please [file an issue](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scut/issues) or [contact me](https://github.com/davidtheclark).
