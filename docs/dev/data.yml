            comment: Set to `true` if you want to pass a single color value for the `$inactive` and `$active` arguments and you want that value interpreted as `background-color`. (By default, a single value will be intepreted as `color`.)

          A shortcut for setting an element's inactive and active colors &mdash; text `color` and `background-color` &mdash; with the option of adding a transition.

          The "active state" includes `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active`.

          This technique is most commonly used to provide (semantic, accessible, SEO-friendly, etc.) text that will be (visually) replaced with an image.

          Apply rules to `:hover`, `:focus`, and (optionally) `:active` states. Make your site more friendly for touchscreens, keyboard navigators, etc.

          *Don't forget to add a `tabindex` to any element that will need it for `:focus`.*

        text: |
          **`scut-reset` is an additional file that you should import into your Sass/SCSS only if you want it.** You may not want it.

          I've found myself implementing the same element-specific resets over and over again, project after project &mdash; making headers semantic rather than presentational; removing all default button styling, which never gets used; and so on. So I decided to store those resets in an SCSS file. That's what `scut-reset` is.

          [Have a look at the file](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scut/blob/master/_scut-reset.scss) to see what `scut-reset` does and assess whether you would like to include it in your own project.

          If you do want to use `scut-reset`, simply import the file `_scut-reset.scss` after your other resets (e.g. [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)).
          <pre class="language-scss"><code>@import "path/to/scut-reset";</code></pre>
          You should find it in the root directory, alongside `_scut.scss`.

            comment: The `width` and `height` of the element-to-be-centered (both optional). To bypass either and avoid centering in that dimension, pass `n` (for `null`). See below.
        text: |
          Center an absolutely positioned element: horizontally, vertically, or both ways.

          This method only works if the element-to-be-centered has fixed dimensions &mdash; fixed width if you want it centered horizontally, fixed height if you want it centered vertically.

          If you do not want to center horizontally &mdash; only vertically &mdash; pass `n` (short for `null`, "no," "nothing," etc.) for the `width` value. Same goes for height, if you do not want to center vertically. See the examples below for clarification.
        example:
          html: |
            <div class="eg-center-absolutely-container">
              <div class="eg-center-absolutely m-1">Centered both horizontally and vertically</div>

        text: |
          Pair icons from your sweet icon fonts with text labels, using semantic HTML and no extraneous elements.

          By default, icons are grafted on as `inline-block` pseudo-elements, vertically centered with the label.

          Icons can be placed on the left or right of the label, spaced according to your learn&egrave;d discretion. And extra customization is possible by either passing a content block or adding rules to the relevant pseudo-element.

          The examples below illustrate some of the possibilities.

        example:
          html: |
            <p>Push the play button and hover over the others</p>

        text: |
          Float the items of an unstyled list &mdash; to the left or to the right, with or without spacing between them.

          Use a floated list instead of an inline list when you want your list items snuggled right next to each other.

          Only the list's immediate children are floated (`ul > li`): Scut does not presume to know what you might plan to do with sub-lists.
        example:

        text: |
          Inline the items of an unstyled list.

          ("Inline" is a hip new verb: use liberally.)

          Use an inline list if you don't mind your list items spaced out a little, like inline words. If you need them flush, with no interstitial space, try a [floated list](#floated-list).

          Only the list's immediate children are inlined (`ul > li`): Scut does not presume to know what you might plan to do with sub-lists.
        example:

        text: |
          Keep your HTML semantic and your punctuation traditional.

          Since the most common punctuated list uses commas, commas are the default `$divider` and the comma list is available as its own placeholder:

          Only the list's immediate children are punctuated (`ul > li`): Scut does not presume to know what you might plan to do with sub-lists.

        text: |
          A floated list ([see above](#list_floated)) with punctuation between each list item.

          A couple of common variations have their own placeholders:

          - **`%scut-list-bar`**
          - **`%scut-list-breadcrumb`**

          But, of course, all things are possible.

          The `$height` argument is kind of tricky: If you want a `$divider` taller than your list items, you need include the height here to ensure that everything stays in a nice neat horizontal line, vertically aligned in the middle. See the example below for clarification.

          Only the list's immediate children are divided (`ul > li`): Scut does not presume to know what you might plan to do with sub-lists.

              A list: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` coordinates. `n` abbreviates `null`. `a` is interchangeable with `auto`. See below.

          A shortcut for assigning coordinates to an element.

          You *may* want to use this mixin on its own &mdash; but **this mixin's primary purpose is to facilitate those below**, which will pair your coordinates with a `position` value.

          Some guidlines for this mixin and its followers:

          - **`n` (the default value) signifies `null` or "nothing" or "no"** &mdash; so any coordinate assigned `n` is simply ignored, creating no rule in compiled CSS.
          - **`a` can abbreviate `auto`** (both will work).
          - **All four values must be passed**: so use `n` as needed.

          See the examples below.

        text: |
          Give an element with unknown or fluid width a fixed aspect ratio.

          **Implementation involves two elements**:

          - The outer element, to which the mixin applies, whose width will determine the width of the ratio-box.
          - The inner element, whose selector must be passed to the mixin as the `$inner` (second) argument, and whose content will manifest as the content of the ratio-box. The inner element should be an *immediate child* of the outer element (it's selected with the CSS selector `>`, the "child combinator").

          The examples should demonstrate.
        example:
          html: |
            <p>These containers have different widths, but the ratio-boxes remain squares.</p>
            <div class="eg-ratio m-1">

                  <!-- Content! -->

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>And the same principle applies to these, which maintain a 16:9 ratio and use a different classname for the inner element:</p>
            <div class="eg-ratio m-3">

        text: |
          Ensure that your footer stays down at the bottom of the viewport, where God intended it to be, even if your content is too short to keep it down naturally. Avoid the weird look people give you when they see your footer in the middle of their browser window and unsettling emptiness beneath.

          This one takes some commitment &mdash; but nothing you can't handle:

          - Your sticky footer must have a fixed height.
          - Your stuff-above-the-footer must be wrapped in a wrapper element. (The footer itself remains outside of this wrapper.)

          **This mixin should not be invoked within a declaration block.** It needs to add rules for a number of elements &mdash; `html`, `body`, the wrapper, and the footer &mdash; so it can't be nested within a selector.

          **For an example of the Scut sticky footer in action, [have a look at this Codepen](http://codepen.io/davidtheclark/pen/ExjiF)**. Play around with it.

          Vertically center text (or other inline elements) by equalizing an element's `height` and `line-height`.

          Although this method is soothingly, reassuringly simple, requiring none of the extra `<div>`'s that make us all second-guess ourselves, it is also limited. **This method only works for inline content (usually text) that will not exceed a single line.** So it's good for buttons and headings with backgrounds and things like that.

          If you need to vertically center something else, try one of the mixins below.
        example:
          html: |
            <p class="eg-vcenter-lh">
              Vertically centered text

          Vertically center *an inner element* with the `inline-block` method.

          **This method requires a container and an inner element.** The mixin applies to the container; the to-be-centered inner element is passed (by its selector) as an argument.

          Any to-be-centered element should be an *immediate child* of the container (`container > inner`).

          A word of caution: Because `inline-block` results in some unpredictable word-like spacing, this method doesn't always work well if you require exact widths (or if your inner element has a 100% width). If you require exactitude and nothing stands in the way of giving your container `display: table`, try [vertically centering via table display](#vertically-center-via-table-display).
        example:
          html: |

          The mixin can produce equilateral and isosceles triangles pointing up, down, left, and right; or right triangles with their right angles in the top right, top left, bottom right, and bottom left corners.

          When choosing `width` and `height` values, consider how their proportion will determine the form. For example, to create an equilateral triangle, you'll want your `height` value to be ~140% of your `width` value (`width` * &radic;2). Anybody remember high school geometry?

          The "hanging indent" applies to all lines but the first &mdash; as opposed to the "normal" indent, applying to only the first line, that you're accustomed to from those print publications you may have seen.

          My <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> also calls it the <i>flush-and-hang</i> style. I like that.

          Hanging indents are standard fare for indexes and works cited, but may seem obscure to you (if you're no scholar) until one day you realize that you do need them, and have needed them all along ...
        example:
          html: |
            <div class="eg-hanging-indent m-1">Lastname, Firstname. <cite>Title of the Work</cite>. City, State: Publisher, YEAR. Print.
            </div>
            <div class="eg-hanging-indent m-2">Lastnameofanotherguy, Firstname. <cite>Title of the Another Work</cite>. City, State: Publisher, YEAR. Print.
            </div>

        text: |
          You've probably been wondering how to semantically markup your lists of keys and values &mdash; your labelled bits of information. You've probably been gnawing your fingernails to nubs, panicked with uncertainty. Well: The answer seems to be **description (or <i>association</i>) lists** &mdash; the `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` elements. (See the References listed below.)

          WhatWG says "The dl element represents an association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a description list)." There you have it.

          One common way of *styling* such assocation (description) lists is with colon-separated name-value pairs, the first line flush left and following lines indented (the fabled ["hanging indent"](#hanging_indent)).

          This mixin should help make that dream a reality &mdash; with enough flexibility so you can play around, and really make that assocation list your own.

          **Apply the mixin to your `<dl>` element.**
        example:
          html: |
            <dl class="eg-key-val m-1">
              <dt>Name</dt>
              <dd>Lorem Ipsum</dd>
              <dt>Occupation</dt>
              <dd>Placeholder</dd>
              <dt>Children</dt>
              <dd>None</dd>
              <dt>Excuses</dt>
              <dd>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl class="eg-key-val m-2">
              <dt>Consolation</dt>
              <dd>Alleviation of misery or distress of mind</dd>
              <dt>Depression</dt>
              <dd>A sinking of the spirits</dd>
              <dt>Equanimity</dt>
              <dd>A state of resistance to elation, depression, anger, etc.</dd>
            </dl>

        text: |
          Replace standard link underlining with a bottom border.

          People like this, at least some people, because it provides a little extra space between the text and the line. Other pleasing effects are also possible by passing arguments.

          Of course, as always, you can add your own rules after the mixin to further customize. For example, if you want to define a special color for the bottom-border on hover, just do it (see the example below).
        example:
          html: |
            <p class="eg-link-bb m-default">Default values: <a href="#link-with-bottom-border">Link text</a></p>
            <p class="eg-link-bb m-styled">Variant values: <a href="#link-with-bottom-border">Link text</a></p>

        text: |
          Italicize a section of text while de-italicizing those elements that would normally be italicized. Stand the world on its head.

          This is a common typographical practice: in non-italicized text, italics provide mild stress; but in italicized text, it is the non-italicized text that is stressed.

          The elements `<em>`, `<cite>`, and `<i>`, which browsers typically italicize, are by default de-italicized. To de-italicize more elements, include some selectors in a list that you pass to the mixin.

        example:
          html: |
            <p class="eg-reverse-italics m-default">DEFAULT:
              <em>Some &lt;em&gt; text</em> sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

        text: |
          Everybody loves this flourish: horizontal lines extending from either side of center-aligned text.

          Look at the examples below. You want to do that!

          The lines will be vertically aligned with the text's center &mdash; but sometimes that will look off, and you'll want to tweak that vertical position. So add some height to the `$m-adjust` argument, which will push your lines up, away from the bottom of the element.

          By default, the mixin produces one line; but if you add a height to the `$double` argument, you'll get two lines (separated by that height). (You could also use a `$style` of `double`, which would act the same as any double border-style.)
        example:
          html:
            <p class="eg-side-lined m-1">Variation 1</p>
            <p class="eg-side-lined m-2">Variation 2</p>
            <p class="eg-side-lined m-3">Variation 3</p>
            <p class="eg-side-lined m-4">Variation 4</p>

            comment: A base-value with which to calculate the `em`-value. If there are no units, it's interpreted as *pixels*; but you can use `em`-values, as well.
        text: |
          Convert pixel-values to `em`-values.

          This function eases the burden on those who build flexible, `em`-based layouts but still find themselves thinking in pixels or using tools that speak in pixels.

          It provides some flexibility for situations in which the `em`-value has to be calculated in relation to something other than a default `16px` `font-size`.

          If a `$base` argument is provided, the `em`-value will be calculated relative to that `$base`. If that `$base` is in pixels, everything should work smoothly, no questions asked. *You can also provide a `$base` in ems* &mdash; but this is trickier: it will only work if your `em`s are not more than one layer deep. For example, if your element is the child of a container whose `font-size` is an `em`-value other than `1em`, you can pass the `font-size` as the `$base` argument and everything will work fine (see example variations 5 and 6), But if the container has a `font-size` in `em`s (not `1em`), and a child of it has a `font-size` in `em`s (also not `1em`), and your messing with a grandchild ... and I don't suggest trying to use this function three or more levels deep in `em`s.
        example:
          html: |
            <div class="eg-em-c">
              <div class="eg-em m-1">

              <div class="eg-em m-2">
                Variation 2: 300px wide, in regular pixels
              </div>

              <div class="eg-em m-3">
                Variation 3: 400px wide, in ems, with a different base size in px
              </div>

              <div class="eg-em m-4">
                Variation 4: 400px wide, in pixels, with a different base size in px

      **use-name** is the name of the utility's mixin and placeholder, including the `scut-` prefix, as they should appear in your Sass/SCSS. This should be illustrated in the examples.
  -
    term: type
    content: |
      **type** tells you how you can invoke the utility. Is it only available as a mixin (e.g. HD breakpoint)? Or as a mixin and a placeholder that always do the same thing (e.g. clearfix)? Or as a mixin and a placeholder that passes default values (e.g. indented paragraphs)? Or as a mixin with some extension placeholders for common variations (e.g. punctuated list)?

      If no default value is listed, that means there is no default value, so you'll have to provide a value every time you use the mixin.
